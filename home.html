                    <p><strong>Hi, i'm Samuele</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in software
                        development, automation, and applied artificial intelligence. I enjoy
                        building practical solutions that simplify complex processes,
                        especially when technology can be used to improve efficiency and
                        accessibility in real-world contexts. Throughout my academic
                        and professional experiences,I have developed a solid foundation in
                        programming, problem solving, and system design, while continuously
                        expanding my knowledge in areas such as Machine Learning, workflow
                        automation, and hardware. I am particularly motivated by learning
                        through hands-on projects and by exploring how emerging technologies
                        can be integrated into everyday workflows to create meaningful impact.

                    <p><strong>My skills and experience</strong></p>
                    <br>
            
                    <p>I hold a solid academic and practical background in Computer Science, with hands-on experience in software
                        development, automation, and applied artificial intelligence. During my internal internship project at ATS
                        Insubria, I worked in a healthcare-oriented environment where I developed solutions aimed at improving
                        operational efficiency and access to information. In particular, I contributed to the design and
                        implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot based on large language models, built using
                        Copilot Studio, with the goal of enabling both internal staff and assisted users to quickly retrieve
                        accurate information from extensive and heterogeneous document repositories. Alongside this, I designed and
                        implemented an automated OCR-based workflow using n8n, capable of extracting structured data from medical
                        prescriptions and securely storing it in a database, strengthening my skills in workflow automation, data
                        processing, and system integration.
            
                        In parallel, my experience as a private tutor and instructor at Happy School allowed me to consolidate my
                        knowledge of programming languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++, while also improving my
                        ability to explain complex technical concepts clearly and effectively. Teaching both in structured
                        educational environments and through independent one-to-one lessons enhanced my communication skills,
                        adaptability, and problem-solving mindset, as well as my ability to prepare clear documentation and study
                        materials.
            
                        Beyond strictly technical roles, my work experience in high-intensity environments such as McDonald’s and
                        food delivery services contributed significantly to my professional growth. These roles strengthened my
                        organizational skills, time management, reliability, and ability to work efficiently under pressure, often
                        within fast-paced teams and continuously changing workflows. I also gained familiarity with digital ordering
                        and management systems, reinforcing my confidence in interacting with technology in real-world operational
                        contexts. Overall, these combined experiences have shaped me into a versatile professional with strong
                        technical foundations, a proactive attitude toward learning, and a practical, results-oriented approach to
                        problem solving.

                    <br>
                    <p> Beyond technology, I cultivate a variety of interests that
                        help me maintain creativity, balance, and discipline.
                        I practice 3D animation as a personal hobby, which 
                        allows me to explore visual design, spatial thinking, 
                        and creative problem solving. I also enjoy cooking, 
                        an activity that combines experimentation and precision, 
                        as well as going to the gym, which helps me stay focused 
                        and consistent over time. Finally, reading plays an important 
                        role in my routine, supporting continuous learning and 
                        broadening my perspective both professionally and personally.
