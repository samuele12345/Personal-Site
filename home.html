                        <br>
                        <p> I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in software
                            development, automation, and applied artificial intelligence. I enjoy
                            building practical solutions that simplify complex processes,
                            especially when technology can be used to improve efficiency and
                            accessibility in real-world contexts. Throughout my academic
                            and professional experiences,I have developed a solid foundation in
                            programming, problem solving, and system design, while continuously
                            expanding my knowledge in areas such as Machine Learning, workflow
                            automation, and hardware. I am particularly motivated by learning
                            through hands-on projects and by exploring how emerging technologies
                            can be integrated into everyday workflows to create meaningful impact.

                        <br>
                
                        <p>I hold a solid academic and practical background in Computer Science, with hands-on experience in software
                            development, automation, and applied artificial intelligence. During my internal internship project at ATS
                            Insubria, I worked in a healthcare-oriented environment where I developed solutions aimed at improving
                            operational efficiency and access to information. In particular, I contributed to the design and
                            implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot based on large language models, built using
                            Copilot Studio, with the goal of enabling both internal staff and assisted users to quickly retrieve
                            accurate information from extensive and heterogeneous document repositories. Alongside this, I designed and
                            implemented an automated OCR-based workflow using n8n, capable of extracting structured data from medical
                            prescriptions and securely storing it in a database, strengthening my skills in workflow automation, data
                            processing, and system integration.
                
                            In parallel, my experience as a private tutor and instructor at Happy School allowed me to consolidate my
                            knowledge of programming languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++, while also improving my
                            ability to explain complex technical concepts clearly and effectively. Teaching both in structured
                            educational environments and through independent one-to-one lessons enhanced my communication skills,
                            adaptability, and problem-solving mindset, as well as my ability to prepare clear documentation and study
                            materials.
                
                            Beyond strictly technical roles, my work experience in high-intensity environments such as McDonald’s and
                            food delivery services contributed significantly to my professional growth. These roles strengthened my
                            organizational skills, time management, reliability, and ability to work efficiently under pressure, often
                            within fast-paced teams and continuously changing workflows. I also gained familiarity with digital ordering
                            and management systems, reinforcing my confidence in interacting with technology in real-world operational
                            contexts. Overall, these combined experiences have shaped me into a versatile professional with strong
                            technical foundations, a proactive attitude toward learning, and a practical, results-oriented approach to
                            problem solving.

                        <p> Beyond technology, I cultivate a variety of interests that
                            help me maintain creativity, balance, and discipline.
                            I practice 3D animation as a personal hobby, which 
                            allows me to explore visual design, spatial thinking, 
                            and creative problem solving. I also enjoy cooking, 
                            an activity that combines experimentation and precision, 
                            as well as going to the gym, which helps me stay focused 
                            and consistent over time. Finally, reading plays an important 
                            role in my routine, supporting continuous learning and 
                            broadening my perspective both professionally and personally.
