                    <p><strong>Project 1 - Copilot Studio</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I worked on the design and development of a Retrieval-Augmented 
                        Generation (RAG) chatbot based on large language models, 
                        created to provide practical and reliable support to both 
                        internal operators and assisted users in navigating a large 
                        and heterogeneous document repository. The solution was developed 
                        using Microsoft Copilot Studio and focused on improving accessibility to information while maintaining clarity, consistency, and usability.
                        The chatbot architecture was structured around three distinct 
                        automated flows, each with a specific responsibility within the 
                        conversational lifecycle. The first flow handled the 
                        initialization of the conversation, managing user greetings, 
                        context setup, and intent recognition. The second flow was 
                        dedicated to the core conversational logic, where user queries 
                        were processed, relevant documents were retrieved, and responses 
                        were generated using a RAG approach to ensure accurate and 
                        context-aware answers. A third fallback flow was implemented 
                        to manage ambiguous inputs, unsupported requests, or 
                        low-confidence scenarios, allowing the system to gracefully 
                        handle errors and guide the user toward clearer interactions.
                        This modular design improved the robustness, maintainability, 
                        and scalability of the chatbot, while also reinforcing my 
                        experience in conversational system design, workflow 
                        orchestration, and the practical application of large language 
                        models in real-world, information-intensive environments.

                    <p><strong>Project 2 - N8N</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I designed and implemented an automated OCR-based workflow aimed 
                        at extracting structured information from medical prescription 
                        documents and securely storing it in a PostgreSQL database. 
                        The entire pipeline was developed using n8n as the orchestration 
                        environment, enabling seamless integration between email 
                        services, cloud-based processing, external OCR APIs, and database 
                        systems. The workflow begins when a user submits a document by 
                        sending it to a dedicated bot email address. The attachment is 
                        automatically received and processed, then optimized through 
                        compression using Cloudinary to reduce file size while preserving 
                        readability. Once prepared, the document is sent to the OCR.Space 
                        service via structured POST and GET requests, where textual data 
                        is extracted from the image or PDF content. After extraction, the 
                        relevant information is parsed, validated, and stored in a 
                        PostgreSQL database for long-term archiving and retrieval. 
                        To complete the process, the system automatically sends a 
                        confirmation email via Gmail, notifying the user that the 
                        document has been successfully received, processed, and 
                        archived. This project strengthened my experience in workflow 
                        automation, API integration, asynchronous processing, and data 
                        persistence, while highlighting the importance of reliability 
                        and traceability in healthcare-related digital systems.

                    <br>
            
                    <p>I developed a full-stack e-commerce platform for handcrafted 
                        products, featuring both customer and admin interfaces. 
                        The platform integrates a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS 
                        to manage products, inventory, and user data. Customers can 
                        browse the store, register accounts, and log in to make purchases, 
                        while the admin interface allows authorized users to update 
                        product listings, manage inventory, and monitor store activity.
                        Payment functionality is simulated through a Stripe integration, 
                        allowing secure checkout and realistic testing of transactions. 
                        The main page welcomes users with a clean and intuitive 
                        interface, designed to provide a seamless shopping experience. 
                        This project enhanced my skills in full-stack development, 
                        database management, user authentication, and e-commerce 
                        workflow design. The project was developed in VS code environment
                        using HTML, CSS and Javascript languages.<br><br>

                    <br>
            
                    <p>I developed an Android application using Kotlin in Android Studio 
                        that functions as a versatile audio recording tool. The app 
                        allows users to record audio clips and manage them in a 
                        dedicated database, where each recording can be saved, deleted, 
                        or edited in terms of length and name. Users can play back any 
                        saved recording directly within the app, and a search feature 
                        enables quick retrieval based on the recording’s name. <br>
                        This project helped me strengthen my skills in mobile 
                        development, database management, and user interface design, 
                        while also giving me practical experience with Kotlin, Android

                    <br>
                    <p> I created a website for a Korean restaurant, primarily using HTML 
                        with some CSS for styling. The project includes a main page 
                        presenting the restaurant, a dedicated menu page, and an ordering

                        organizing multiple pages within a coherent website. It was

                        carousel. The website includes an “About Me” section to present

                        professional work, and a “Contact” page to allow users to get
